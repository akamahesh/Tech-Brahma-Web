# Tech-Brahma
Tech-Brahma is a fanpage of Tech-God who solves trivial problems (i.e. Bug fixes, build issues) of fellow developers like bug-fixes. The Idea is that Real God don't have time for our trivial problems, So to provide an alternative I have created Tech-Brahma. Developers can list their bugs,pray,and even Donate for the maintaince of this online temple...:)
